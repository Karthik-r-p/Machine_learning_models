# Machine_learning_models


Worked on various ML algorithms on different datasets to build models and further calculated the accuracy using different accuracy metrics such as RMSE nd confusion matrix. 

Worked on EDA and data visualisation techniques.

Executed variable selection techniques to understand important variables to build a model.

Performed cross validation and hyper parameter tuning to increase the accuracy of models.

Understood the overfitting and underfitting concepts.
